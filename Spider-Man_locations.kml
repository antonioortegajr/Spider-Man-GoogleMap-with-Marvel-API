    <name>Spider-Man locations</name>
    <description><![CDATA[Places of interest in the life of The Amazing Spider-Man. Locations are based on Marvel.com when able. Others are from a map in the “Official Handbook to the Marvel Universe”. Plenty of help from SpiderFan.org and SpiderVillain.com. Some are based on their mention in various Spidey titles.

Locations are speculation unless otherwise noted with an official address of some sort. Some may change with the addition of google earth into google maps. If you are even looking at this then you are most likely nerdy enough to know how to message me with any suggestions.
Or find me on twitter. http://twitter.com/antonioortegajr
This project will also be on github.

So poorly, that when unmasked the Dr., he refused to believe it to be the real Spider-Man. A good example of how Spider-Man has real problems like a cold.  Also a good example of how hard it can be to have your secret identity revealed.

Also Uncle Ben used to work here when he dated Aunt May..]]></description>
