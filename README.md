Spider-Man Google Maps and Marvel API READ ME


This google map is a map of what I have chosen as important locations in the Spider-Man (616) storyline.

The map is build in javascript and html and based on the Google Maps docs https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/

All points have been chosen by me.

The Marvel API will be used to provide data such as issue cover images, location data, etc..
