Spider-Man Google Maps and Marvel API READ ME


This google map is a map of what I have chosen as important locations in the Spider-Man (616) storyline.

The map is build in javascript and html and based on the Google Maps docs https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/

All points have been chosen by me. See this git hub wiki for any reasons I chose a location or if you would like to suggest a new point be added.

Currently in thte process of chosing the kinds of data that would be standard on any given point.

The points are all locations where an event occured or many events occured to influence the life of Spider-Man

The Marvel API will be used to provide data such as issue cover images, location data, etc..
